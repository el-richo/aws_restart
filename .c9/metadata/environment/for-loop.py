The for statement uses the for â€¦ in keywords to tell the computer to go through the list. A list is generated by the range() function. The range() function takes a starting number and an ending number, but the ending number is not inclusive. Therefore, you pass in 11 to have the function stop counting at 10. The letter x acts as a variable. Each time through the loop, the variable x is assigned to the next variable in the loop and is printed out to the screen."],"id":72}],[{"start":{"row":7,"column":524},"end":{"row":8,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":73}],[{"start":{"row":8,"column":0},"end":{"row":8,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["\"\""],"id":74}],[{"start":{"row":8,"column":2},"end":{"row":8,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["\""],"id":75}],[{"start":{"row":1,"column":24},"end":{"row":2,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":76}],[{"start":{"row":1,"column":24},"end":{"row":2,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""],"id":77}],[{"start":{"row":2,"column":3},"end":{"row":3,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":78}],[{"start":{"row":3,"column":0},"end":{"row":3,"column":21},"action":"insert","lines":["print(\"Count to 10!\")"],"id":79}],[{"start":{"row":2,"column":3},"end":{"row":3,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":80},{"start":{"row":3,"column":0},"end":{"row":4,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""]}],[{"start":{"row":3,"column":0},"end":{"row":4,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":81}],[{"start":{"row":4,"column":0},"end":{"row":4,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["\"\""],"id":82}],[{"start":{"row":4,"column":2},"end":{"row":4,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["\""],"id":83}],[{"start":{"row":4,"column":3},"end":{"row":5,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":84}],[{"start":{"row":5,"column":0},"end":{"row":5,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["\"\""],"id":85}],[{"start":{"row":5,"column":2},"end":{"row":5,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["\""],"id":86}],[{"start":{"row":4,"column":3},"end":{"row":5,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":87}],[{"start":{"row":5,"column":0},"end":{"row":5,"column":342},"action":"insert","lines":["In Python, you can include a large amount of functionality in a few words.
