Exercise 1: Working with a while loop
A while loop makes a section of code repeat until a certain condition is met. In this exercise, you will create a Python script that asks the user to correctly guess a number.

Printing the game rules
From the navigation pane of the IDE, choose the .py file that you created in the previous Creating your Python exercise file section.

Use the print() function to inform the user about your game:
"""
print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
print("The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.")
number = random.randint(1,10)
isGuessRight = False

"""
Importing random and writing a while loop
You will use the import command to include code that someone else wrote. Up to now, you have been using built-in functions. Recall that a function is a piece of reusable code.

At the top of the file, include the Python module (which is a type of library) called random.
Place the cursor on the next line after the second print() statement. Next, enter a statement that will generate a random number between 1 and 10 by using the randint() function of the random module.
Track whether the user guessed your number by creating a variable called isGuessRight:
"""

"""
To handle the game logic, create a while loop:
"""

while isGuessRight != True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
    if int(guess) == number:
        print("You guessed {}. That is correct! You win!".format(guess))
        isGuessRight = True
    else:
        print("You guessed {}. Sorry, that isnâ€™t it. Try again.".format(guess))
        

"""
Note: The while loop will repeat the code inside the loop until the number is guessed correctly, which is represented by the condition isGuessRight != True in the code. Additionally, Python uses indentation to determine logic blocks, or what statements are considered to be part of the while loop. You can indent a line by placing the cursor next to a statement and pressing TAB."
